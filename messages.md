📢 Anybody up for a coding challenge? 🤓

The 🧪 Mad Coders crew is inviting everyone to solve a new coding challenge. To participate, you must solve the coding challenge attached to this message (.zip file) by no later than this coming &lt;long-date&gt;.

🎲 how to participate:
- To participate, you’ll have to write a reply to this very same message and attach your solution in a .zip file. Loose replies will not be considered. Your zip file must contain the challenge name and your name (e.g.: challenge.JohnDoe.zip).
- All solutions will be published so that the whole crew can vote for the best implementations this coming &lt;long-date&gt;.
- Your code implementation must be written using JavaScript. Why? Just because we like to be eccentric.
- The winner gets to take home honor and respect! 💪

❓ got any questions?
Feel free to contact Carlos Jasso and he’ll be happy to answer them.

📢 Time to cast your vote 🗳

The 🧪Mad Coders crew would like to thank each participant on our latest code challenge. Now, it’s time to determine what implementation is the best!
You can find attached to this message a .zip file featuring the implementations from all participants. Feel free to grab any implementation and play with it.
You can only vote today and at the end of the day a winner will be named!

🎉 How to vote

Since zoom does not natively provide a voting/poll feature, we’ll make use of emojis 🐒. React to this message with the emoji assigned to each participant to vote for their solution.
You may only vote for the solution you think is best. If there’s more than one that you like, you may prize them all with comments and feedback.

🤔 Voting criterion

Evaluating code is not an easy task. Opinion and perspective are both important and that’s what makes this interesting. A good coding solution should be:
- Efficient: The operation should be completed in a timely manner and using as little space as possible.
- Reliable: There should be little to no room for error in the code.
- Consistency: The code sticks to the requirement in the task and produces the expected output every time it’s executed.
- Readability: Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. – Martin Fowler
