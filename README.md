📢 Anybody up for a coding challenge? 🤓

The 🧪 Mad Coders crew is inviting everyone to solve a new coding challenge. To participate, you must solve the coding challenge attached to this message (.zip file) by no later than this coming &lt;long-date&gt;.

🎲 how to participate:
- To participate, you’ll have to write a reply to this very same message and attach your solution in a .zip file. Loose replies will not be considered.
- All solutions will be published so that the whole crew can vote for the best implementations this coming &lt;long-date&gt;.
- Your code implementation must be written using JavaScript. Why? Just because we like to be eccentric.
- The winner gets to take home honor and respect!
